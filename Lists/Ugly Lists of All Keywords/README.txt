Here is a list of all keywords used by vanilla armors/weapons/spells across all types, some may not be used in 
every type, some may be VERY situational, working to get a full list of them and example uses.

This might be useful if you are looking for a particular thing or if you are trying to find new 
fancy things to do manually, but for the most part this is just a big pile of examples for different 
boosts/passives/status.

If you see something that looks like you might be able to use, copy it and then go to the lists of
vanillaArmor/vanillaWeapon/Spell_[type] and use the find tool to see if you can figure out its use case.

If you manage to figure out what a strange new keyword does and implement it successfully, it would 
be very helpful if you are able to write out a sentance or two explaining and an example into a post,
I want to put togeather a majorly complete set so that I can simplify the process as much as possible
while giving the user the most options available.
