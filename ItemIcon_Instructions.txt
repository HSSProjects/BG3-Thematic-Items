In order to get the full set of item icons to choose from you will need 
to unpack the Game.pak file inside your bg3 steam install

SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3\Data\Game.pak

You can do this by pulling up the LSLib Toolkit and navigating to the PAK/LSV tab, 
then select the Game.pak in the extract package section and set a folder to extract to.

The Icons will then be inside of ExtractLocation\Public\Game\GUI\Assets\Tooltips\ItemIcons
